## Intro

**Meetlily Music** (also stylized as **meetlily**, with a lowercase k) is a simple web-based personal audio streaming service written in [Vue](http://vuejs.org/) on the client side and [Laravel](http://laravel.com/) on the server side. Targeting web developers, Meetlily Music embraces some of the more modern web technologies – CSS grid, audio, and drag-and-drop API to name a few – to do its job.

## Install and Upgrade Guide

For system requirements, installation/upgrade guides, troubleshooting etc., head over to the [Official Documentation](https://docs.meetlily.net/music).

## API Docs

If you're interested in the development of a client, Meetlily's offical API documentation is available [here](https://api-docs.meetlily.net/music).

## Contribute

All contributions, big or small, are warmheartedly welcome! Please note, however, that if you want to work on a new feature, first open an issue to make sure it's something desired – doing this will greatly save time for all of us.

A quick and easy way to start hacking on koel is to open and run this repo in Gitpod, an online IDE with full Laravel support.
